              <p>In terms of the drilling speed of self-tapping and self-drilling screws and the strength requirement of high-strength bolt over grade 8.8, heat treatment is the most crucial part of screw post-process. Since the heat treatment will determine the screw quality, a capable heat treatment furnace can precisely control the furnace temperature.</p>
