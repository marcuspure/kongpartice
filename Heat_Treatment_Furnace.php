            <p>In terms of the drilling speed of self-tapping and self-drilling screws and the strength requirement of high-strength bolt over grade 8.8, heat treatment is the most crucial part of screw post-process. Since the heat treatment will determine the screw quality, a capable heat treatment furnace can precisely control the furnace temperature.</p>

              Longer mesh belt lifecycle: It’s sustained by a special roller conveyor system.
              Precise temperature: In furnace, the automatic segmentation temperature control keeps the temperature accurate.
              Force ventilation fan: It will stir and mix the atmosphere to make sure the temperature is even.
              Automatic atmosphere control: Quality and quantity of production is guaranteed, and the furnace lifecycle will be lengthened.
              High production capacity and low abrasion: The furnace design aims to recycle resources and power.
              Easy operation: once the heat treatment conditions are set, it will be run automatically. No special techniques required.
              Furnace atmosphere choices: It can work with endothermic gas or carbinol instillation.
              Specialized heating elements: It’s easy to change components and maintain. It runs either with electricity or gas, depending on its power source.

              The final process for screw-making is the surface treatment. The coated film on the surface makes screws aesthetic and anti-corrosive. Our electroplating equipment takes the design of barrel plating. A consistent production process is applied in the production line. Process equipments include: pretreatment,
