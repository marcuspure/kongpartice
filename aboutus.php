                    <p>Basic ejector punches, such as DIN9861-D, and round pin punches can be ready for shipment in 2 weeks. We can also pre-store punches for clients so that the shipment can be ready in 3 days. We also have hexagon punches for DIN912 in storage. Be free to contact us for the punch sizes in storage.</p>
                    <p>We provide punches in different materials, such as high speed steels (M2,M35 and M42), powder metallurgies (ASP23, ASP30 and ASP60) and tungsten carbide. We also provides options for surface coating: TiN, TiAIN, AlCrn,TiCN, etc. Suggestions will be provided </p>

                  <p> The surface finish of a punch has a great impact on its lifecycle. Besides the regular finish, we can also apply special sand-blasting finish and surface heat treatment to lower abrasion and production stress on the surface. In this way, the lifecycle of the punches can be prolonged to 2 times longer. The shape and tolerance of the punches will be strictly monitored. As for punches in crucial sizes, the tolerance can be as fine as +/-0.005mm. </p>

                    <p>Besides dies for fasteners, KONFU keeps developing new die market in other application fields. Powder metallurgy die is the priority among our development projects. Although powder metallurgy die is more complicated in formation and process procedure, it can form special shapes that cold forging fails to form. Therefore, powder metallurgy die is widely utilized in many fields, such as automobile components and home appliances. </p>

For die design, we will adjust the die matching, to gain extra die lifecycle, according to the powder material and density used by client. We can also provide all kinds of inspection gages and examine jigs for measurement in powder metallurgy production. The gage tolerance can be as fine as 0.001mm. </p>
