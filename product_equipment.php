            </p>
            <p class="machine_text">Nevertheless, we are not complacent about our achievements and still endeavor to provide our clients with the most proper solutions. When our clients want to produce new products, we stand by their sides. With a persistent attitude, we keep studying how to refine the die design and help clients produce ideal fasteners.
            </p>
            <p class="machine_text">
              When clients have service length or precision problems at production, we will manage to analyze them from different perspectives and thus conduct modifications to answer clients with satisfying solutions.
            </p>
            <p class="machine_text">Besides, We increase our capital expenditure year by year to replace and purchase all kinds of new machines. We also keep training our staff’s production skill with a perfectionist attitude.</p>
            <p class="machine_text">We implement strict quality control in production process. In order to monitor every workpiece at production, we implement a tracing system with production barcode. At pre-shipment quality inspection, we will cross-compare the products with the original design and run a full scale test. </p>
            <p class="machine_text">Our task is to shorten delivery date as much as possible without compromising the quality. </p>

Since the 60’s, KONFU has been endeavoring to provide fastener producers around the world with tsungsten carbide dies made in Taiwan. </p>
                  <p>Our tsungsten carbide, with the most stable quality, is provided by the largest tungsten carbide supplier in Taiwan.

                <p>If client’s primary die has lifecycle issues, we are more than happy to give modification suggestions according to the die’s problems. For instance, we can add vents to the die or change the manner of mold assembly. Until now, KONFU has accumulated numerous successful cases to demonstrate our capability to help our clients to optimize their production.</p>

                <p> The surface finish of a punch has a great impact on its lifecycle. Besides the regular finish, we can also apply special sand-blasting finish and surface heat treatment to lower abrasion and production stress on the surface. In this way, the lifecycle of the punches can be prolonged to 2 times longer. The shape and tolerance of the punches will be strictly monitored. As for punches in crucial sizes, the tolerance can be as fine as +/-0.005mm. </p>

We can also provide all kinds of inspection gages and examine jigs for measurement in powder metallurgy production. The gage tolerance can be as fine as 0.001mm. </p>
