When our clients want to produce new products, we stand by their sides. With a persistent attitude, we keep studying how to refine the die design and help clients produce ideal fasteners.
            </p>
            <p class="machine_text">
              When clients have service length or precision problems at production, we will manage to analyze them from different perspectives and thus conduct modifications to answer clients with satisfying solutions.
            </p>
            <p class="machine_text">Besides, We increase our capital expenditure year by year to replace and purchase all kinds of new machines. We also keep training our staff’s production skill with a perfectionist attitude.</p>
            <p class="machine_text">We implement strict quality control in production process. In order to monitor every workpiece at production, we implement a tracing system with production barcode. At pre-shipment quality inspection, we will cross-compare the products with the original design and run a full scale test. </p>
            <p class="machine_text">Our task is to shorten delivery date as much as possible without compromising the quality. </p>

          <p> The surface finish of a punch has a great impact on its lifecycle. Besides the regular finish, we can also apply special sand-blasting finish and surface heat treatment to lower abrasion and production stress on the surface. In this way, the lifecycle of the punches can be prolonged to 2 times longer. The shape and tolerance of the punches will be strictly monitored. As for punches in crucial sizes, the tolerance can be as fine as +/-0.005mm. </p>
